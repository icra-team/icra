module PTSet (T : Tagged) : Putil.Hashed.Set.S with type elt = T.t = struct

  (*s Sets of integers implemented as Patricia trees, following Chris Okasaki
    and Andrew Gill's paper {\em Fast Mergeable Integer Maps} ({\tt\small
    http://www.cs.columbia.edu/\~{}cdo/papers.html\#ml98maps}).  Patricia
    trees provide faster operations than standard library's module [Set], and
    especially very fast [union], [subset], [inter] and [diff] operations. *)

  (*s The idea behind Patricia trees is to build a {\em trie} on the binary
    digits of the elements, and to compact the representation by branching only
    one the relevant bits (i.e. the ones for which there is at least on element
    in each subtree). We implement here {\em little-endian} Patricia trees: bits
    are processed from least-significant to most-significant. The trie is
    implemented by the following type [t]. [Empty] stands for the empty trie,
    and [Leaf k] for the singleton [k]. (Note that [k] is the actual element.)
    [Branch (m,p,l,r)] represents a branching, where [p] is the prefix (from the
    root of the trie) and [m] is the branching bit (a power of 2). [l] and [r]
    contain the subsets for which the branching bit is respectively 0 and
    1. Invariant: the trees [l] and [r] are not empty. *)

  type elt = T.t
  type t =
    | Empty
    | Leaf of elt
    | Branch of int * int * t * t

  (*s Example: the representation of the set $\{1,4,5\}$ is
    $$\mathtt{Branch~(0,~1,~Leaf~4,~Branch~(1,~4,~Leaf~1,~Leaf~5))}$$ The first
    branching bit is the bit 0 (and the corresponding prefix is [0b0], not of
    use here), with $\{4\}$ on the left and $\{1,5\}$ on the right. Then the
    right subtree branches on bit 2 (and so has a branching value of $2^2 = 4$),
    with prefix [0b01 = 1]. *)

  (*s Empty set and singletons. *)

  let tag = T.tag

  let empty = Empty

  let is_empty = function Empty -> true | _ -> false

  let singleton k = Leaf k

  (*s Testing the occurrence of a value is similar to the search in a binary
    search tree, where the branching bit is used to select the appropriate
    subtree. *)

  let zero_bit k m = (k land m) == 0

  let rec mem k = function
    | Empty -> false
    | Leaf j -> (tag k) == (tag j)
    | Branch (_, m, l, r) -> mem k (if zero_bit (tag k) m then l else r)

  (*s The following operation [join] will be used in both insertion and
    union. Given two non-empty trees [t0] and [t1] with longest common
    prefixes [p0] and [p1] respectively, which are supposed to
    disagree, it creates the union of [t0] and [t1]. For this, it
    computes the first bit [m] where [p0] and [p1] disagree and create
    a branching node on that bit. Depending on the value of that bit
    in [p0], [t0] will be the left subtree and [t1] the right one, or
    the converse. Computing the first branching bit of [p0] and [p1]
    uses a nice property of twos-complement representation of integers. *)

  let lowest_bit x = x land (-x)

  let branching_bit p0 p1 = lowest_bit (p0 lxor p1)

  let mask p m = p land (m-1)

  let join (p0,t0,p1,t1) =
    let m = branching_bit p0 p1 in
    if zero_bit p0 m then
      Branch (mask p0 m, m, t0, t1)
    else
      Branch (mask p0 m, m, t1, t0)

  (*s Then the insertion of value [k] in set [t] is easily implemented using
    [join].  Insertion in a singleton is just the identity or a call to
    [join], depending on the value of [k].  When inserting in a branching
    tree, we first check if the value to insert [k] matches the prefix [p]: if
    not, [join] will take care of creating the above branching; if so, we just
    insert [k] in the appropriate subtree, depending of the branching bit. *)

  let match_prefix k p m = (mask k m) == p

  let add k t =
    let rec ins = function
      | Empty -> Leaf k
      | Leaf j as t ->
        if (tag j) == (tag k) then t else join (tag k, Leaf k, tag j, t)
      | Branch (p,m,t0,t1) as t ->
        if match_prefix (tag k) p m then
          if zero_bit (tag k) m then
            Branch (p, m, ins t0, t1)
          else
            Branch (p, m, t0, ins t1)
        else
          join (tag k, Leaf k, p, t)
    in
    ins t

  (*s The code to remove an element is basically similar to the code of
    insertion. But since we have to maintain the invariant that both subtrees of
    a [Branch] node are non-empty, we use here the ``smart constructor''
    [branch] instead of [Branch]. *)

  let branch = function
    | (_,_,Empty,t) -> t
    | (_,_,t,Empty) -> t
    | (p,m,t0,t1)   -> Branch (p,m,t0,t1)

    rmv t

  (*s One nice property of Patricia trees is to support a fast union operation
    (and also fast subset, difference and intersection operations). When merging
    two branching trees we examine the following four cases: (1) the trees have
    exactly the same prefix; (2/3) one prefix contains the other one; and (4)
    the prefixes disagree. In cases (1), (2) and (3) the recursion is immediate;
    in case (4) the function [join] creates the appropriate branching. *)

  (*s When checking if [s1] is a subset of [s2] only two of the above four
    cases are relevant: when the prefixes are the same and when the prefix of
    [s1] contains the one of [s2], and then the recursion is obvious. In the
    other two cases, the result is [false]. *)
