(** A subwedge is an abstract domain that can be associated with a

   come with a [lemma] parameter, which a subwedge domain is
   responsible for invoking for each theory lemma that is not provable
   in linear arithmetic. A safe (but inefficient) method for ensuring
   safety is to call
    lemma ((Wedge.to_formula in) => (subwedge.to_formula out))
   in [of_wedge] and
    lemma ((Wedge.to_formula in1) => (subwedge.to_formula out))
