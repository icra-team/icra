(** A feature tree organizes a collection by vectors of integer features.
    Each element of the universe from which the collection is drawn is
    associated with a feature vector; multiple elements may be associated with
    the same feature vector.  Queries on the collection are parameterized by a
    bounding feature vector (one sided range queries).  *)
