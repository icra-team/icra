 * graph[i][j] contains the set of vas transformers from

 * transition states that model i to transition states that model 
 * j when s_lst is used as lin simulation.
 *
 * s_lst (simulation list) defined as in vas:

 * may contain the column representing all 0s.
 * The first row of the first item
 * in S_lst is matched with the first row of "a" and "b"

 * There is exactly one item in S_lst for each coherence class
 * of V. A coherence class is defined as a set of rows that
