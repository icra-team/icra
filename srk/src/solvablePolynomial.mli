(** Solvable polynomial maps.  A polynomial map [f : Q^n -> Q^n] is
   solvable if its circular dependencies are linear (e.g. [f(x,y) =
   (x+1,y+x^2)] is solvable but [f(x,y) = (y^2,x)] is not).  *)

   forms may use operators from Berg's operational calculus,
   represented as uninterpreted function symbols that will be
   allocated upon calling [exp]. *)
