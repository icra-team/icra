srk
====

Srk (symbolic reasoning kit) is a library for reasoning about logical
formulas.  Documentation for the srk API can be found
[here](http://cs.princeton.edu/~zkincaid/srk/doc/index.html).  An outline of
the main functionality implemented in the library:

 + `Iteration`: approximate transitive closure of transition relations.
   Described in
   [FMCAD:FK2015](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~zkincaid/pub/fmcad15.pdf) and
   [POPL:KCBR2018](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~zkincaid/pub/popl2018a.pdf).
 + `Quantifier.simsat`: evidence-producing SMT solver for the theories LRA and LIA (with quantifiers).  Described in [IJCAI:FK2016](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~zkincaid/pub/ijcai16.pdf).  The procedure `simsat_forward` is an improved algorithm that should be preferred in most circumstances.
 + `Quantifier.winning_strategy`: strategy-synthesis procedure described in Section 4 of [POPL:FK2018](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~zkincaid/pub/popl18b.pdf).  (The procedure described in Section 5 can be found [here](https://github.com/zkincaid/strategy-improvement))
 + `Wedge`: wedge abstract domain.  Described in section 4 of [POPL:KCBR2018](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~zkincaid/pub/popl2018a.pdf)
 + `Abstract`: symbolic abstraction routines (over-approximate a formula by a property in some abstract domain)
 + `Nonlinear.linearize`: Formula linearization (over-approximate a formula with non-linear arithmetic by one with only linear arithmetic).  Described in Section IV of [FMCAD:FK2015](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~zkincaid/pub/fmcad15.pdf).

Srk also provides an interface to several other libraries, including
 + [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3): SMT solver
 + [Apron](http://apron.cri.ensmp.fr/library): numerical abstract domain library
 + [OCRS](https://github.com/cyphertjohn/OCRS): recurrence solver
 + [NTL](http://www.shoup.net/ntl/): number theory library

Building
========

### Dependencies

Srk depends on several software packages.  The following dependencies need to be installed manually.

 + [opam](http://opam.ocaml.org) (with OCaml >= 4.02 & native compiler)
 + [GMP and MPFR](https://gmplib.org/)
 + [NTL](http://www.shoup.net/ntl/)

On Ubuntu, you can install these packages with:
```
 sudo apt-get install opam libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libntl-dev
```

On MacOS, you can install these packages with:
```
 brew install opam gmp mpfr ntl
```

Next, add the [sv-opam](https://github.com/zkincaid/sv-opam) OPAM repository, and install the rest of duet's dependencies.  These are built from source, so grab a coffee &mdash; this may take a long time.
```
 opam remote add sv git://github.com/zkincaid/sv-opam.git
 opam install ocamlgraph batteries cil oasis ppx_deriving Z3 apron ounit menhir  OCRS ntl
```

### Building srk

After srk's dependencies are installed, it can be built with `make`.  Srk's makefile has the following targets:
 + `make`: Build srk and `bigtop` command-line utility.
 + `make doc`: Build documentation
 + `make test`: Run test suite

Running srk
===========

The srk library is packaged with a command-line utility `bigtop` that can be
used to access some of its functionality.  Documentation for running `bigtop`
can found by executing `bigtop.native -h`.
